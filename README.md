## Gamepass Saves

If you're playing Palworld through Xbox Game Pass, you must extract and convert your save files using the **XGP-save-extractor** and **PalWorldSaveTools**. Follow these steps:

---

### XGP-save-extractor

- [XGP-save-extractor GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Z1ni/XGP-save-extractor)

---

### Steps

1. **Extract the Save Files**  
   - Download and unzip the **XGP-save-extractor**.  
   - Run the program, follow the prompts in the command prompt, and it will output a ZIP file containing your Xbox Game Pass Palworld save files.

2. **Locate the Save File**  
   - Unzip the exported file.  
   - Navigate to the nested folder named `Level` and locate the file named `01.sav`.

3. **Rename the Save File**  
   - Rename `01.sav` to `Level.sav`.

4. **Prepare the Save Tools**  
   - Unzip the **PalWorldSaveTools** folder.

5. **Move the Save File**  
   - Move the renamed `Level.sav` file into the **PalWorldSaveTools** folder.

6. **Convert Save to JSON**  
   - Drag `Level.sav` onto the `convert-sav-to-json.cmd` file.  
   - A new file named `Level.sav.json` will be created in the same folder.

7. **Delete the Original Save**  
   - Delete the `Level.sav` file you moved earlier.

8. **Convert JSON Back to Save**  
   - Drag `Level.sav.json` onto the `convert-json-to-sav.cmd` file.  
   - You should now have a newly converted `Level.sav` file ready to use.

## Automatically Delete Player Saves Based on Inactivity

Follow these steps to delete inactive players based on your criteria (e.g., inactivity, level, or number of pals):

1. Copy all files from your server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`) to the same location within the tool (`PalworldSaveTools\`).  
2. Run `fix_save.cmd`.  
3. Run `sort_players.cmd` and/or `delete_pals_save.cmd`.  
4. Copy the `Players` folder from the tool.  
5. Delete the original `Players` folder from the server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`).  
6. Paste the copied `Players` folder into the server folder.  
7. Restart the server:  
   - Reboot once to clear the player from `Level.sav`.  
   - Reboot a second time to clear the player from RAM.  
8. Profit?
